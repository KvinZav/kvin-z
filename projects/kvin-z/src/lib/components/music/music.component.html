<h1>Hello, Goodbye</h1>

<p>
  You say, "Yes", I say, "No"<br>
  You say, "Stop" and I say, "Go, go, go"<br>
  Oh, no!<br>
  You say, "Goodbye" and I say, "Hello, hello, hello"<br>
  I don't know why you say, "Goodbye", I say, "Hello, hello, hello"<br>
  I don't know why you say, "Goodbye", I say, "Hello"...<br>
